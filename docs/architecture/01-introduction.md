## **Introduction**

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Proficiency**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for this modern fullstack application.

### **Starter Template or Existing Project**

N/A - This is a greenfield project. The architecture will be designed from scratch based on the specified technology stack, without using a pre-packaged starter template. We will define a custom monorepo structure tailored to the project's needs.
