# Risk Profile: Story 1.1: Project Initialization

Date: 2025-10-10
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 1
- **Overall Risk Score: 58/100**

The project initialization story is fundamentally high-risk due to the number of core technologies being integrated and configured at once. A failure in this story will block all subsequent development. The primary concern is the stability and correctness of the containerized local development environment.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [OPS-001]: Docker Compose Environment Instability

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - The `docker-compose.yml` configuration is complex, involving five services, networking, build contexts, and a reverse proxy. The likelihood of misconfiguration in networking, volume mounts, or service dependencies is high.
**Impact**: High - If the Docker Compose environment fails to start or operate reliably, the local development environment will be unusable, blocking all developers.
**Mitigation**:
- **Preventive:**
    - Conduct peer reviews of the `docker-compose.yml` and associated `Dockerfile`s.
    - Create a simple, step-by-step validation script that starts the services and runs health checks against each one (e.g., curls the API, checks the web frontend).
- **Testing Focus**:
    - Execute end-to-end tests that confirm inter-service communication (e.g., frontend calls to the backend API via the Caddy proxy).
    - Test on multiple host operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) to ensure consistency.
    - Verify data persistence for the `db` service by restarting containers.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- **Operational:** 2 risks (1 critical)
- **Technical:** 3 risks (1 high)

### By Component
- **Infrastructure (Docker/CI):** 3 risks
- **Backend (`apps/api`):** 1 risk
- **Frontend (`apps/web`):** 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                        | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                             |

| OPS-001  | Docker Compose Environment Instability | High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Critical | Implement validation scripts; conduct extensive testing on multiple platforms.                                  |
| TECH-001 | Monorepo Configuration Complexity  | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Use `pnpm` documentation and examples; create simple shared packages to test workspace resolution early.        |
| TECH-002 | Inconsistent Scaffolding           | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Create checklists based on architecture documents to verify directory structures and initial file creation.     |
| OPS-002  | Brittle CI/CD Pipeline             | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Run the CI pipeline against different branches and scenarios to ensure robustness. Isolate pnpm and Python setup steps. |
| TECH-003 | Dependency Version Mismatches      | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      | Use a dependency analysis tool (e.g., `pnpm audit`) early; lock dependency versions in configuration files. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (Must be part of AC)
- **Scenario:** Full Environment Startup
  - **Action:** Run `docker-compose up -d --build`.
  - **Expected:** All 5 services (`db`, `redis`, `api`, `worker`, `web`) start without errors.
- **Scenario:** Frontend to Backend Communication
  - **Action:** Access the web application in a browser and trigger an action that calls the backend API (e.g., fetch data from a placeholder endpoint).
  - **Expected:** The request is successfully proxied by Caddy to the `api` service, and a valid response is returned.
- **Scenario:** Database Persistence
  - **Action:** Create data via an API endpoint, run `docker-compose down`, then `docker-compose up`.
  - **Expected:** The created data remains intact.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Scenario:** Monorepo Workspace Resolution
  - **Action:** Create a shared utility in `packages/` and import it into both `apps/web` and `apps/api`.
  - **Expected:** The code is correctly resolved and utilized in both applications.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- The placeholder unit tests for frontend and backend should be executed successfully within the CI pipeline.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Merging
- The `docker-compose` environment must be stable and pass all Priority 1 test scenarios.
- The monorepo configuration must allow for basic inter-package dependencies.

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Thoroughly test the docker-compose setup across different environments (e.g., Mac, Linux, Windows).'
      - 'Validate inter-service communication, especially the web-to-api proxy.'
    monitor:
      - 'Monorepo dependency management for conflicts.'
      - 'CI pipeline stability and execution times.'
