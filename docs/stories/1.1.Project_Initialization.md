# Story 1.1: Project Initialization

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Super Admin/Developer,
**I want** the project monorepo and core service scaffolding to be initialized,
**so that** a consistent development environment is established for the team.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A monorepo structure is created and configured using pnpm workspaces.
2. A placeholder FastAPI application for the backend is created within `apps/api`.
3. A placeholder React/TypeScript application for the frontend is created within `apps/web` using Vite.
4. A `docker-compose.yml` file is created at the root to run the `api`, `web`, `worker`, `db`, and `redis` services for local development.
5. A basic CI/CD pipeline is configured in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run linters and placeholder tests on commit.
6. A comprehensive `README.md` file is created at the project root, containing the project title, a brief description, and clear instructions on how to run the local development environment.

## Dev Notes

This story establishes the foundational structure of the entire project based on the architecture documents.

### **Project Structure & Tooling**

-   **Monorepo:** The project is a `pnpm` workspace. The structure is defined in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` at the root. [Source: `docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md`]
-   **Root `package.json`:** Must define the workspaces (e.g., `"packages": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]`) and top-level scripts for linting and testing.
-   **Applications:**
    -   `apps/web`: Frontend React/TS application.
    -   `apps/api`: Backend FastAPI application.
-   **Shared Packages:** The `packages/` directory should be created for future shared code (`shared-types`, `config`, `ui`).

### **Backend (`apps/api`)**

-   **Framework:** FastAPI [Source: `docs/architecture/03-tech-stack.md`]
-   **Language:** Python 3.12.x [Source: `docs/architecture/03-tech-stack.md`]
-   **Structure:** The initial structure should follow the layered architecture defined in `docs/architecture/11-backend-architecture.md`. Create the following directories: `src/api/v1/endpoints`, `src/core`, `src/db`, `src/models`, `src/repositories`, `src/schemas`, `src/services`, `src/worker`.
-   **Dependencies:** Create a `requirements.txt` with `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `SQLAlchemy`, `alembic`, `pydantic`, `python-jose[cryptography]`, `passlib[bcrypt]`, `rq`, `redis`.

### **Frontend (`apps/web`)**

-   **Framework:** React 19.x with TypeScript 5.6.x [Source: `docs/architecture/03-tech-stack.md`]
-   **Build Tool:** Vite 5.x. The project should be initialized using a Vite template (e.g., `pnpm create vite apps/web --template react-ts`).
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS. A `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` must be created. [Source: `docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md`]
-   **Structure:** Create the initial directory structure inside `apps/web/src`: `components/ui`, `components/layouts`, `components/shared`, `components/features`, `pages`, `routes`, `services`, `hooks`, `lib`, `context`, `types`.

### **Containerization & Orchestration**

-   **`docker-compose.yml`:** This file at the project root is critical. It must define the following services:
    -   `db`: MariaDB 11.x image.
    -   `redis`: Redis image (for RQ).
    -   `api`: Builds from `apps/api/Dockerfile`. Runs the FastAPI app with `uvicorn`.
    -   `worker`: Builds from a separate `apps/api/worker.Dockerfile`. Runs the RQ worker.
    -   `web`: Uses a Caddy server to serve the static files from `apps/web/dist` and reverse proxy `/api` to the `api` service.
        [Source: `docs/architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md`, `docs/architecture/12-unified-project-structure.md`]

### **CI/CD**

-   **`ci.yml`:** A basic GitHub Actions workflow located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
-   **Jobs:** It should have a single job `ci` that checks out code, installs `pnpm` and Python dependencies, and has placeholder steps for running linters and tests.
    [Source: `docs/architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md`]

## Testing

This story's testing is critical to ensure the foundation of our project is stable. The following tests must be performed.

### **Risk-Based Testing (Manual & Automated)**

The following scenarios directly address the critical risks identified during the QA review. These must be successfully executed before the story can be considered complete.

#### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

-   **Scenario: Full Environment Startup**
    -   **Action:** Run `docker-compose up -d --build`.
    -   **Expected:** All 5 services (`db`, `redis`, `api`, `worker`, `web`) start without errors and are accessible.
-   **Scenario: Frontend to Backend Communication**
    -   **Action:** Access the web application in a browser and trigger an action that calls the backend API (e.g., fetch data from a placeholder `/health` endpoint).
    -   **Expected:** The request is successfully proxied by Caddy to the `api` service, and a valid JSON response is returned.
-   **Scenario: Database Persistence**
    -   **Action:** Create data via an API endpoint, run `docker-compose down`, then `docker-compose up`.
    -   **Expected:** The created data remains intact after the services restart.

#### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

-   **Scenario: Monorepo Workspace Resolution**
    -   **Action:** Create a simple shared utility in `packages/` (e.g., a formatting function) and import it into both `apps/web` and `apps/api`.
    -   **Expected:** The code is correctly resolved and utilized in both applications without build or runtime errors.

### **Placeholder Unit & Integration Tests**

-   **Backend:** Placeholder test files should be created in `apps/api/tests/` using `pytest`. For example, `apps/api/tests/test_main.py` that checks a basic `/` endpoint. [Source: `docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md`]
-   **Frontend:** Placeholder test files should be created co-located with components in `apps/web/src/` using `vitest`. For example, `apps/web/src/App.test.tsx`. [Source: `docs/architecture/16-testing-strategy.md`]
-   The CI pipeline must successfully execute all placeholder tests.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-10

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

This is a preliminary review of the story definition while in `Draft` status. No code has been written. The story is well-defined, with clear acceptance criteria, detailed developer notes, and traceability to architecture documents. The primary quality concern is the inherent risk of the implementation itself.

### Refactoring Performed

None.

### Compliance Check

-   Coding Standards: [✓] (N/A for draft)
-   Project Structure: [✓] (Story aligns with documentation)
-   Testing Strategy: [✗] (The story's `Testing` section is a good start but lacks the specific, risk-based scenarios required to mitigate the identified critical risk.)
-   All ACs Met: [✗] (Story is in Draft)

### Improvements Checklist

-   [ ] **CRITICAL:** The `Testing` section of this story must be updated to include the specific, high-priority test scenarios identified in the risk profile, particularly those for validating the Docker Compose environment.
-   [ ] Consider creating a small, automated script to validate the local environment's health after `docker-compose up`.

### Review Date: 2025-10-10

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The workspace scaffolding is cohesive and the FastAPI/React placeholders line up with the architecture documentation. `pnpm --filter @proficiency/web test` passes, and `apps/api/tests/test_main.py` exercises the health endpoint. Tailwind is wired through the v4 CSS-first workflow (`@tailwindcss/vite` plus `@import "tailwindcss";` in `apps/web/src/index.css`), which matches the v4 guidance that configuration now lives in CSS via `@theme` if customization is needed (Tailwind Labs blog “Tailwind CSS v4.0” – context7). The remaining blocker is that the backend test script in `apps/api/package.json:6` uses `python -m pytest || echo ...`, which masks real failures—the command prints “pytest not configured” instead of failing when pytest is missing—so CI cannot surface regressions.

### Refactoring Performed

None.

### Compliance Check

-   Coding Standards: [✓] Follows documented conventions for layout and module boundaries.
-   Project Structure: [✓] Directory scaffolding matches the unified project structure guidance.
-   Testing Strategy: [✗] Backend test script swallows pytest failures because of the `|| echo` guard (`apps/api/package.json:6`).
-   All ACs Met: [✗] AC5 (CI placeholder tests) is undermined while backend tests cannot fail the pipeline.

### Improvements Checklist

-   [ ] **CRITICAL:** Let backend tests fail loudly by removing the `|| echo "pytest not configured"` guard so CI can detect pytest failures (`apps/api/package.json:6`).
-   [ ] Sync the architecture docs/dev notes with Tailwind v4’s CSS-first configuration approach so future stories reference the current workflow.

### Security Review

No new security risks identified in the scaffolding.

### Performance Considerations

Backend Docker images currently install heavy ML libraries (torch, transformers); keep but reassess before production to control image size.

### Files Modified During Review

None.
