### **Section 3: User Interface Design Goals**

#### **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience will embody **Modern, Data-Centric Professionalism**. The interface must feel clean, intuitive, and trustworthy, visually communicating a significant upgrade from traditional university systems. The design should prioritize clarity and ease-of-use, presenting complex evaluation data through simple, digestible visualizations. The design should actively avoid the cluttered, table-heavy, and visually dated aesthetic common in traditional enterprise portals. **Clarity and intuitive data visualization are the primary goals**.

#### **Core Screens and Views**

* **Students:** Login, Dashboard, Evaluation History, Profile Management.
  * The Student Dashboard will feature two tabs: "Pending Evaluations" (default) and "Completed Evaluations" for the current, active period. The "Pending Evaluations" view will default to a clear **matrix or table format**, with a user-selectable control to switch to a **card-based view**.
* **Faculty:** Login, Dashboard (view personal results), Evaluation Insights, Performance Trends, Report Generation, AI Suggestion Page, Profile Management.
* **Department Heads:** All Faculty views, plus a tabbed dashboard ("Overview" and "Explore Data") for department-level results, the ability to evaluate faculty, and Evaluation History (for their own submissions).
* **Admins:** Similar views as Department Heads (a tabbed "Overview" and "Explore Data" dashboard for institutional, department, and faculty levels), but with no AI Suggestion Page. Plus: Review Flagged Evaluations, Form & Period Management, Academic Structure Management, and User Management (Bulk Import).
* **Super Admins:** Login, Dashboard (platform metrics), University Management, User Management, Profile Management.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Card-Based Layout:** Content will be organized into distinct cards with rounded corners and subtle shadows.
* **Data-First Dashboards:** The primary landing page for all roles will be a dashboard that immediately surfaces relevant data.
* **Responsive Sidebar Navigation:** A consistent, collapsible sidebar will serve as the primary navigation method.
* **Tab-Switching & View Modes:** Dashboards may use tabs to separate key data contexts (e.g., Overview vs. Explore Data) and offer view-switching controls where appropriate.
* **Contextual Clarity & Consistency:** The UI must always provide clear indicators of the user's current view (e.g., "Viewing: Department of IT Results"). The modern design aesthetic must be applied consistently across all parts of the application.
