# Continue Full-Stack Architecture Document — Rebuild the Data Model Section

We are continuing the full-stack architecture document. Specifically, we stopped after finishing the **Data Model** section. Upon review, that section is lackluster, incomplete, unrefined, and not properly aligned with nuanced requirements and functionalities in the **PRD**, **front-end-spec**, and the current database schema/structure in the **data dictionary**.

**Directive:** Go back to the **Data Model** section and rebuild it with proper attention, verification, and strict, critical analysis of the **PRD**, **front-end-spec**, and **Database-Schema-Data-Dictionary-of-Proficiency**. Ensure the section is complete, thorough, and integrated so that it prevents conflicts during development.

## Contextual Files (Main Focus)

1. **fullstack-architecture.md** — the incomplete/current full-stack architecture document.
2. **prd.md** — completed PRD detailing planned system information.
3. **front-end-spec.md** — a recently completed document detailing UI/UX principles and specifications for the planned system.
4. **Newly_Updated-Database-Schema-Data-Dictionary-of-Proficiency.pdf** — contains all currently planned database tables and the entire database structure/schema. Treat this as the current database baseline; read, verify, analyze, and incorporate it, while cross-checking against the PRD and front-end-spec for nuanced or newer modifications/additions that may require table changes or new tables to support functionalities.

## Other Contextual Files (Secondary/Supplementary)

1. **project_techstack.md** — thorough documentation of the full tech stack. Although the tech stack section is already confirmed/finished, refer back if misalignments, incompletions, or mistakes are found in the current fullstack-architecture.
2. **requirements.txt** — backend-leaning dependencies/libraries that may not be listed in **project_techstack.md**.
3. **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** — the currently utilized and already initialized project structure for the planned system (in the repository).

Use all provided files as a whole to guide creation of the full-stack architecture document, with the stated priority order.

## Ambiguity Policy

If any ambiguity arises or you are unsure about something, **do not guess**. **Pause and ask clarifying questions first**. Only proceed with producing a section or part after ambiguities are resolved and confirmation is received.

---

## Action Plan & Execution (Only After Ambiguities Are Resolved)

**Step 0 — Ambiguity Check (Gate):** Compile any questions or unclear points found while reviewing the PRD, front-end-spec, data dictionary, and the current fullstack-architecture document. Halt until answers are provided.

**Step 1 — Action Plan Draft (for Approval):** Propose a concise, ordered plan to rebuild the Data Model section. The plan must include:

-   **Scope boundaries** (what is in/out for this pass).
-   **Task breakdown & sequence** (incremental steps to rebuild).
-   **Expected deliverables per step** (e.g., gap list, proposed table changes, constraint notes, updated section text).
-   **Review gates** (where approval is required before moving on).

**Step 2 — Approval Gate:** Wait for explicit approval of the action plan. Do not proceed without approval.

**Step 3 — Incremental Rebuild (Execute per Step):**

-   For each approved step: produce the specified deliverable(s), **limited to the Data Model section**.
-   Present changes clearly (e.g., summarized diffs or section snippets).
-   Pause for confirmation/feedback before proceeding to the next step.

**Step 4 — Finalization:** After the last step is approved, provide the finalized Data Model section ready to be integrated into **fullstack-architecture.md**, and summarize decisions made and remaining follow-ups (if any).

**Principles:** keep changes scoped to the Data Model section; align strictly with PRD + front-end-spec + data dictionary; prevent conflicts downstream; prefer clarity and verifiability over assumptions.
