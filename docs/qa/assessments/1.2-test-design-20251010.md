# Test Design: Story 1.2 - Database and AI Environment Setup

Date: 2025-10-10
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

- Total test scenarios: 7
- Unit tests: 0 (0%)
- Integration tests: 5 (71%)
- E2E tests: 2 (29%)
- Priority distribution: P0: 2, P1: 4, P2: 1

This test design focuses heavily on **Integration tests** because the story is entirely about the integration and setup of infrastructure components (database, migration tool, Docker). There is no business logic to unit test. E2E tests are used to verify the developer-facing commands that operate the environment.

## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: A database migration tool is integrated into the backend service.

| ID          | Level       | Priority | Test                                       | Justification                                                                    |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.2-INT-001 | Integration | P1       | Verify Alembic configuration is correct    | Validates the tool can connect to the DB. Mitigates **TECH-001**.                |
| 1.2-INT-002 | Integration | P0       | Verify migration script is idempotent      | Ensures re-running migrations is safe. Mitigates **DATA-001**.                   |

### AC2: An initial migration script is created that generates all necessary tables.

| ID          | Level       | Priority | Test                                       | Justification                                                                    |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.2-INT-003 | Integration | P0       | Verify all tables are created              | Validates the primary outcome of the story. Mitigates **DATA-001**.              |
| 1.2-INT-004 | Integration | P1       | Verify key table structures are correct    | Provides higher confidence in schema correctness. Mitigates **DATA-001**.        |
| 1.2-INT-005 | Integration | P1       | Verify a sample SQLAlchemy model relationship | Validates the ORM is correctly mapped to the schema. Mitigates **TECH-002**.     |

### AC3: The migration can be successfully run via a command within the local Docker environment.

| ID          | Level | Priority | Test                                       | Justification                                                                    |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.2-E2E-001 | E2E   | P1       | Verify migration command works via Docker  | Ensures the developer workflow is functional from the host machine.              |

### AC4: A dedicated `Dockerfile` for the RQ worker is created.

| ID          | Level | Priority | Test                                       | Justification                                                                    |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1.2-E2E-002 | E2E   | P2       | Verify worker Docker image builds successfully | Ensures AI/ML dependencies can be installed correctly. Mitigates **OPS-001**.      |

## Risk Coverage

- **DATA-001 (Critical)**: Covered by `1.2-INT-002`, `1.2-INT-003`, `1.2-INT-004`.
- **TECH-001 (High)**: Covered by `1.2-INT-001`.
- **TECH-002 (High)**: Covered by `1.2-INT-005`.
- **OPS-001 (Medium)**: Covered by `1.2-E2E-002`.

## Recommended Execution Order

1.  **P0 Integration Tests** (`1.2-INT-002`, `1.2-INT-003`): Fail fast if the core migration is broken or incomplete.
2.  **P1 Integration Tests** (`1.2-INT-001`, `1.2-INT-004`, `1.2-INT-005`): Verify configuration and data model integrity.
3.  **P1 E2E Test** (`1.2-E2E-001`): Confirm the developer command works as expected.
4.  **P2 E2E Test** (`1.2-E2E-002`): Run last as it can be slow and is not on the critical path for the API.
