# Handoff Notes for Architect (Winston)

This document contains action items for the Architect based on the Product Owner's master validation checklist review.

---

### 1. Add Dependency Management Strategy

**Subject: Add Dependency Management Strategy**

Winston, please update the `architecture.md` document. Add a subsection under "Development Workflow" or "Repository Structure" that defines a clear strategy for managing and resolving dependency conflicts. This should include best practices for the monorepo, such as using `pnpm` workspaces for the frontend and `pip` constraints for the backend to ensure stability.

---

### 2. Define Core Infrastructure Stories

**Subject: Define Core Infrastructure Stories**

Winston, the plan needs explicit sequencing for core components. Please work with the PM to define foundational stories in Epic 1 or 2 for:

1.  **API Middleware:** Creating shared API middleware (e.g., request logging, error handling, auth context).
2.  **Mocking Strategy:** Establishing a testing infrastructure that includes a mock server (like MSW or a simple Express app) and a strategy for seeding mock data. This is critical for parallel frontend/backend development and must be in place early.

### 3. Add DNS and Deployment Prerequisites to Architecture

**Subject: Add DNS and Deployment Prerequisites to Architecture**

Winston, please update the `architecture.md` document's "Deployment Architecture" section. Add a subsection for "Deployment Prerequisites" that includes:

1.  The requirement for a registered domain name.
2.  A plan for managing DNS records (e.g., A records for the VPS IP).

### 4. Specify Asset Optimization Strategy

**Subject: Specify Asset Optimization Strategy**

Winston, please add a subsection to the "Frontend Architecture" section of `architecture.md`. Title it "Asset Optimization Strategy" and briefly specify that the Vite build will be configured for standard production optimizations, including code-splitting per route, tree-shaking, and minification.
