### 1. Assign External Service Management (Critical)

**Subject: CRITICAL - Assign External Service Management**

Sarah, the project plan has a major gap. We need to use external services like the Gemini API, but no one is tasked with managing them. Please create a new user story or task in **Epic 1** titled "Provision and Configure External Services." This task must be assigned to a **human user** (e.g., the Project Lead or a client representative) and its acceptance criteria must include:

1.  Creating accounts for all required third-party services.
2.  Acquiring all necessary API keys and credentials.
3.  Securely documenting and providing these credentials to the development team.

Development on dependent features cannot proceed without this.
